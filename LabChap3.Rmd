# Libraries

The `library()` function is used to load libraries, or groups of functions and data sets that are not included in the base `R` distribution. Basic functions that perform least squares linear regression and other simple analyses come standard with the base distribution, but more exotic functions require additional libraries. Here we load the `MASS` package, which is a very large collection of data sets and functions. We also load the `ISLR` package, which includes the data sets associated with this book.
